Fashion-MNIST Image Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
This project explores the classification of clothing items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The goal was to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning model through a series of experiments focused on hyperparameter optimization, activation function comparisons, and optimizer variations.

Key Features:
Dataset Analysis: Conducted thorough data exploration, visualizing the dataset and understanding class distributions and pixel intensities.
Preprocessing: Implemented feature engineering techniques such as scaling and normalizing values to improve model stability and performance.
Model Architecture: Experimented with various ANN architectures, including hidden layer size variations, batch normalization, and different activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).
Optimization: Fine-tuned learning rates and optimizers (e.g., Adam) to achieve optimal performance.
Evaluation: Used k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation, with final test accuracy reaching 90%.
Future Enhancements: Suggestions for exploring CNNs, transfer learning, ensemble methods, and model deployment.
This repository contains the code, data preprocessing techniques, and detailed results from the experiments conducted, along with recommendations for future improvements.
